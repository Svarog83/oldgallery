Installation Guide

** in zp-config.php:

Make sure to make use of website_title and website_url on lines 40 and 41.
For example:
$conf['website_title'] = "BenSpicer.com";
$conf['website_url'] = "http://www.benspicer.com"; 

Change lines 94 and 95 to 80 instead of 85:

$conf['thumb_crop_width']  = 80;
$conf['thumb_crop_height'] = 80;

Change lines 101 and 102.  Change albums_per page to 99, and change images_per_page to however many images you would like to display on one album page (if you have more then they will go to page 2).  
Try different numbers in each album and see how it looks - I like 25.

$conf['albums_per_page'] = 99;
$conf['images_per_page'] = 20;

** Go to:
yourwebsite.com/zen/themes/stoppeddesign/index.php
go to line 40 and edit:
<p>Photo Gallery</p>
to something more imaginative and descriptive, such as:
<p>Hi, this is my awesome photo gallery of awesome photos, taken with my awesome -insert camera name- camera</p>

Enjoy, the Stoppeddesign theme should now be working for you :)
